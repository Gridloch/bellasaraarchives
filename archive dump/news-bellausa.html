                HIDDEN CITY GAMES&trade; INTRODUCES BELLA SARA&trade;, THE TRADING-CARD GAME AND ONLINE WORLD FEATURING POSITIVE MESSAGES FOR GIRLS</h2>
                <p>Hidden City Games, whose CEO has played major roles in the worldwide success of other iconic trading-card game brands as Magic: The Gathering and Pok√©mon, has announced that it will be introducing a trading-card game for girls, Bella Sara, to a worldwide market outside of Scandinavia where the game is already a smash hit among girls 5 to 12. Known for its positive themes and messages as well as its stunning and whimsical horse imagery, Bella Sara will be an updated version of the original game, Bella, developed by Denmark-based game-publishing company conceptcard, which has sold over 6 million cards throughout Scandinavia.</p>

                <p>The original concept of Bella comes from Gitte Odder Br&aelig;ndgaard, a former social worker who was inspired to create a product focused on self-love and inner beauty after working with troubled youth in Denmark. The game was named after her daughter's real-life horse. Bella Sara trading cards, which can be collected or used in easy-to-learn card games, also include unique codes that enable girls to activate, care for and play with virtual horses online at www.bellasara.com. In addition to imagination-building online gameplay, Bella Sara features positive written messages on each card designed to uplift girls and reinforce the principle that beauty comes from within.</p>

                <p>"Hidden City Games is thrilled to bring such a socially conscious yet fun-to-play concept to the rest of the world," said Peter D. Adkison, CEO of Hidden City Games, who initially made a name for himself as the CEO of Wizards of the Coast. "In a market that is saturated with products that send young girls mixed messages about beauty and self-assessment, it is personally rewarding to be involved with a product that uniquely addresses self-esteem and endeavors to have a long-term positive influence on girls."</p>

                <p>Bella Sara will launch in key retail stores across the United States in its initial release at the end of October, with more card sets to follow in quarterly expansions. Release into additional markets will follow the North American rollout. Bella Sara cards are purchased in six-card packs that include one rules card and five random horse cards or special "energy cards," all of which have unique activation codes that allow players to play with horses and virtual objects online. The energy cards, which feature such horse-related objects as saddles and bridles, are used to assist in caring for virtual horses or unlock additional content on the game's website, www.bellasara.com. The site features an online community where girls can take care of and play with their virtual horses. Hidden City Games is limiting daily access to the site to one hour, to encourage girls to participate in other activities.</p>
