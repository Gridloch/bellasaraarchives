<h1>Potawatomi</h1>
<h2>"Your cheerful heart brightens the day for everyone around you."</h2>

<ul>
<li>Potawatomi is named for the Native American tribe that inhabited the Great Lakes region of North America before Europeans settled the area.</li>
<li>Potawatomi is an air horse with bright red coat, as distinctive as the plumage of his animal companion, the cardinal.</li>
<li>Potawatomi is shown flying up from a snow field with cardinal, as in the sky a mystic image of cardinal appears.</li>
</ul>

<p>Potawatomi's message involves the positive effect of a positive attitude.  Thinking about what's good and fun, rather than being worried and sad, lifts others' spirits.  Try to give others the gift of your good cheer.</p>
