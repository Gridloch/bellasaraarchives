            <img src="images/SetSymbol-Treasures-small.png" align="left" hspace="5"/>Muck the Stables</h1></a>
	        <p><b>Players:</b> 1 - 3</p>
	        <p><b>Horse Cards:</b> Make a deck with at least 25 cards for each player. (For example, if there are 3 players, the deck should have 75 cards.) </p>
	        <p><b>Setup:</b> Deal each player a hand of 7 horse cards and leave the rest turned facedown.</p>
	        <p><b>Play:</b> On your turn, ask another player for a card with one of the types of symbols on it.  If that player has any cards with the symbol you asked for, she must give one to you. If she doesn’t have any cards with that symbol, she tells you, “Muck the stables!”  You then draw a card from the top of the deck. After you’ve gotten a card, either from the other player or the deck, you may play sets.  A set is any 3 cards with the same symbols and number of symbols or 4 cards with the same symbol that are in numerical order (for example, 1 flower, 2 flowers, 3 flowers, 4 flowers). Once you’ve finished playing sets, play continues clockwise.</p>
			<p><b>Winning:</b> The first player to play 4 sets wins.</p>

            <img src="images/SetSymbol-Treasures-small.png" align="left" hspace="5"/>
            Dusky Trails</h1></a>
	        <p><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</p>
	        <p><b>Horse Cards:</b> One pack of cards per player (minimum 30 cards).</p>
	        <p><b>Setup:</b> Deal each player a hand of 7 horse cards.</p>
	        <p><b>Play:</b> Avoid getting penalty points! The first player lays a card on the table. On your turn, play a card so that the top edge is flat against one side of a card on the table. Only 1 card may be played on each side of a card on the table. You may play your card next to any card on the table, not just the last one.</p>
			<p><b>Winning:</b> The game ends when someone plays all her cards. Add up the penalty points so far, then give each player 1 more point for every card left in her hand. The player with the fewest points wins!</p>	
		
		<a name="art"><h1>
            <img src="images/SetSymbol-Treasures-small.png" align="left" hspace="5"/>
            Art Party</h1></a>
	        <p><b>Players:</b> 2 - 4</p>
	        <p><b>Horse Cards:</b> One pack of cards per player (minimum 30 cards).</p>
	        <p><b>Setup:</b> Deal each player a hand of 7 cards.</p>
	        <p><b>Play:</b> Be the first player to play all the cards in your hand and go out! On your turn, lay a card in the center of the table. Going clockwise, each player plays a card that “matches” your card’s art somehow. Each time a card is played it becomes the new card to match. If you can’t play a matching card, you must pass. Treasure cards are wild. A treasure card automatically matches any card, and any card matches it. <br/><b>Matching Art:</b> Matching Art: It’s up to everyone to decide together if the art matches. Be creative, fair, and generous—remember, games should be fun! A way of matching can only be used once per round. For example, once “both horses are black” is used it can’t be used again, although “both horses are brown” is still allowed. If players disagree about whether a match should count, it counts.</p>
			<p><b>Winning:</b> The first player to run out of cards wins!</p>
		
        <a name="jump"><h1>
            Jump!</h1></a>
	        <p><b>Players:</b> One dealer and two or more players</p>
	        <p><b>Horse Cards:</b> One pack of cards per player (minimum 30 cards).</p>
	        <p><b>Setup:</b> Players are each dealt a card face up.</p>
	        <p><b>Play:</b> The dealer than asks the player if they want to Stay (pass their turn) or Jump! (draw another card). If a player chooses to Stay, they may not change their mind.</p>
			<p><b>Winning:</b> The goal is to get 9 symbols total on all of your cards without going over. If none of the players gets 9 symbols, the player with the most number of symbols without going over wins..</p>
		

		<a name="stableclean"><h1>
             Clean the Stables</h1></a>
	        <p><b>Players:</b> 3-5</p>
	        <p><b>Horse Cards:</b> 60 cards</p>
	        <p><b>Setup:</b> Players are dealt five cards each. Youngest player goes first.</p>
	        <p><b>Play:</b> Players try to acquire three cards possessing the same symbols, with each card showing one more symbol than the last (i.e. 1 sun, 2 suns, 3 suns or 3 suns, 4 suns, 5 suns, etc.) OR three cards with the same symbol and the same number (3 suns, 3 flowers, etc.). When this happens, the player may lay down those cards by placing them down in front of her. Players may only lay down their cards during their turn.</p>
	        <p>On your turn you must ask another player if any of their cards shows a certain symbol: horseshoes, suns, flowers or moons. If the player does have that symbol on one or more of their cards, they must choose one of those cards and then give it to the other player.</p>
	        <p>If the player has no cards with that symbol, they tell the other player "Clean the stables" and that player must draw a new card from the deck. Play then passes to the left.</p>
	        <p><b>Example:</b> Emma asks, "Sara, do you have any horseshoes?"<br />Sara says, "Yes." She gives Emma one of her cards that has horseshoes.<br /> Sara asks, "Peter, do you have any flowers?" <br /> Peter says, "Go clean the stables!" Sara takes another card from the deck.</asp:Localize></p>
			<p>Players can also call for a specific horse card (example: "Do you have Bella?"). If this happens, the player must hand over that card and the player who guessed the card may take another turn.</p>
			<p><b>Winning:</b> The winner is the player who empties her hand first.</p>
		
			<a name="spyglass"><h1>
                Spyglass</h1></a>
	        <p><b>Players:</b> 2 or more.</p>
	        <p><b>Horse Cards:</b> 5 cards per player, minimum.</p>
	        <p><b>Setup:</b> Each player starts with a hand of 5 cards. The youngest player takes the first turn.</p>
	        <p><b>Play:</b> On your turn, announce a detail on the image from one or more of your cards.</p>
	        <p><b>You must say:</b><br /> "With my spyglass I see a _________." The blank is whatever detail the player sees on her card. This detail might even appear on more than one of her cards. You may only use images, not text.</p>
	        <p><b>Sample details are:</b><br />A black horse<br />A mountain<br />Wings<br />A cloud<br />Flowers<br />Water<br />A turtle<br />Lightning<br />A braided mane<br /></p>
	        <p><b>Example:</b> If you have the Halloween card you could say, "With my spyglass I see a pumpkin."</p>
			<p>Play any card or cards featuring that detail. Each card containing that detail remains in front of you and counts as a point. If it's discovered that a card was played and it does not contain the detail, it returns to its player's hand and does not score a point.</p>
			<p>Details must appear on the card, not be implied by the card (for example, the profile of a horse cannot be used for "a horse with two eyes" even though it's assumed the horse in profile has two eyes).
After players lay down their cards the next player (to the first player's left) takes her turn.</p>
			<p>This continues until a player no longer holds any cards. Points are tallied and the winner is the player with the most points. That player starts the next game.</p>
			<p><b>Winning:</b> The highest total of points after three games is declared the champion!</p>
		
			<a name="lasso"><h1>
                Lasso</h1></a>
	        <p><strong>Players:</strong> 3 to 5</p>
	        <p><strong>Horse Cards:</strong> 15, minimum</p>
	        <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Sit in a circle within reach of the deck of cards.</p>
	        <p><strong>Play:</strong> The goal is to "lasso" (i.e. slap) a specified horse card when it is drawn from the deck. Lassoed horses are placed in front of that player (this is called her corral).<br /><br />At the start of the game, the youngest player declares what kind of horse the players should lasso. One by one, each player takes the top card from the deck and places it face up in the middle of the table. If the horse matches the type specified by the player, lasso it by slapping the card.</p>
	        <p><strong>Examples of types of horses include:</strong><br /> Color of horse ("Red")<br />Location of horse ("Mountains")<br />Features of horse ("Wings")<br />First letters in the horse's name ("Name begins with a 'B'")</p>
	        <p>If you lasso the wrong horse, that horse returns to the deck and one of the horses in your corral escapes and returns to the deck. The next player then draws a card and so on until someone lassoes the correct horse. If you do lasso the correct horse, you get to declare the next type of horse to be lassoed.</p>
	        <p><strong>Winning:</strong> The game ends when the deck runs out of cards. The player with the most cards in her corral wins the game.</p>
		
	        <a name="moonlight"><h1>
                Moonlight's Game</h1></a>
	        <p><strong>Players:</strong> 2 to 4</p>
	        <p><strong>Horse Cards:</strong> 4 to 20 per player</p>
	        <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Stack your cards facedown. You can have more
	        than one of the same card in your stack.</p>
	        <p><strong>Play:</strong> All players turn their top card faceup at the same
	        time. Look at everyone’s cards. If your card has the same
	        number of symbols or the same kind of symbols as
	        another player’s card, tap the table. The first player to tap
	        wins the round and starts a face-up bonus pile.</p>
	        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your card has 3 hearts and another card has
	        3 moons, tap the table. If your card has 3 hearts and
	        another card has 1 heart, tap the table.</p>
	        <p>Players keep separate bonus piles so their cards don’t
	        get mixed together. When anyone has played all his cards,
	        everyone shuffles their stacks. (Don’t shuffle your bonus
	        piles.) Continue to play with your shuffled stacks.</p>
	        <p><strong>Winning:</strong> Once any player has gone through her
	        stacks three times, count the symbols on the cards in
	        your bonus pile. The player with the most symbols wins!</p>
        	
	       <a name="bella"><h1>Bella's Game</h1></a>
	        <p><strong>Players:</strong> 1 </p>
	        <p><strong>Horse Cards:</strong> 4 or more.</p>
	        <p><strong>Play:</strong> Mix the cards and arrange them, picture side down,
	        in front of you. Sit still and relax. When you are ready, take
	        a card. Take time to look at the picture and read the text.
	        The horse’s message can be helpful for you. It can help
	        you to think positive, peaceful, and loving thoughts
	        toward yourself and other people. Let these positive
	        thoughts stay with you in everything you do.</p>
        	
	        <a name="leonardo"><h1>Leonardo's Game</h1></a>
	        <p><strong>Players:</strong> 2 to 6</p>
	        <p><strong>Horse Cards:</strong> 20 per player</p>
	        <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Stack your cards facedown. You can have more
	        than one of the same card in your stack.</p>
	        <p><strong>Play:</strong> Draw 7 cards from your stack into your hand. The
	        oldest player turns over the top card on his stack to start
	        a face-up playing pile in front of him. The player to his
	        left looks for a card in her hand that has either the same
	        number of symbols or the same kind of symbols as that
	        card. She plays her card faceup in her own playing pile.</p>
	        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If Peter plays a card with 2 horseshoes, then
	        Gitte can play any card with horseshoes or any card
	        with 2 symbols. If Gitte doesn’t have a matching card,
	        she must draw a card from her stack into her hand. If
	        that card matches, she may play it. If it doesn’t match,
	        her turn ends.</p>
	        <p>Play continues to the left, with each player trying to
	        match the last card played. Players have separate playing
	        piles so their cards don’t get mixed together.</p>
	        <p><strong>Winning:</strong> The first player to play the last card in her
	        hand wins!</p>
