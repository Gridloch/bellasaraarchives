                    <p>
                        When you register at BellaSara.com, you create a unique Username that identifies your Membership Account.  This is the same as your Login ID.  All of your Bella Sara account information, as well as your stables, your Horseshoe bank, your cottage and its contents, are accessed via your Username.

                    <p>
                        A parent email is the email address of the parent who authorized the Bella Sara membership for the child(ren) associated with that parent.  When a child under 13 years of age registers for BellaSara.com, she must obtain permission from a parent, which is granted in the form of an email from the parent.  The email address that the parent uses to send their permission becomes the parent email for the purpose of creating an account to manage their child(ren)’s access to BellaSara.com.  The parent is also asked to create a password.

                    <p>
                        While membership in Bellasara.com is free, as are all of the activities associated with the site, certain digital objects such as decorations for your cottage and virtual toys, require your child to spend horseshoes from their Horseshoe Bank.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With Horseshoes your child may purchase digital objects for her cottage, and purchase other fun items from the Bazaar, such as illustrated online storybooks.  If you want more information, please read the Horseshoe tutorial, which you can find

                        CSC stands for Card Security Code.  One the back of your credit card, near the space allotted for your signature, you will find the last four digits of your credit card number followed by three more numbers.  Enter these last three numbers when CVS is requested.

                        Depending on where you live, sales tax may apply to your purchase.  If you live in the state of Washington, for example, you will owe sales tax on your BellaSara.com purchase.  The calculation of sales tax for your purchase is based on the current rate of tax for your area.  If you live elsewhere, sales tax may not apply to your purchase.

                        Please contact customer service immediately.  It could be that your child has created a new account or has multiple accounts.  Or there may be another problem that Customer Service can solve.  Always remember that there is no possible way for anyone to communicate with your child through BellaSara.com.

                        "I just bought 24,000 horseshoes.  Why does my quantity only add up to 4?"

                    <p>
                        Quantity means the quantity of Horseshoe
                        <span style="">units</span>
                        you purchased, not the total number of Horseshoes.  For example, a purchaser buys 4 Horseshoe units of 6,000 Horseshoes each.  1 Horseshoe unit = 6,000 Horseshoes.  So, if you were trying to divide those Horseshoes up between two usernames, you could give one username 2 units for a total of 12,000 horseshoes or 3 units for a total of 18,000 horseshoes.  But you can’t give one user 4,000 horseshoes and the other 20,000—because your totals have to be divisible by 6,000 (i.e. 1 Horseshoe unit).
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The same is true for the 1,200 Horseshoe unit.  4 Horseshoe units would add up to 4,800 Horseshoes.  So one user could receive all four units equaling 4,800 Horseshoes, 3 units = 3,600 Horseshoes, 2 units = 2,400, or 1 unit = 1,200.

                    <p>
                        When you receive the time-out error, it is because the server has determined that you have been logged on too long before completing your transaction.  To make sure that your credit card is protected, the server deletes all of the purchasing information that you have provided up to that point.  Unfortunately, that means you will need to start over and reenter all of your information in order to complete the purchase.  If you time out frequently, or twice in a row, please contact customer service for specific guidance on how to proceed.
