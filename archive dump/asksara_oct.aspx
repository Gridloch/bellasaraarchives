        <h2>What is your favorite Bella Sara card and why?</h2>
        <p>Shakira, Sarah and Bella are my favorite cards. The drawings are very good and I like the look of "life" in them. I also like the messages; they have wise words for both kids and grown ups.</p>

        <h2>If you could pick one message that you believe in most from the Bella Sara cards - which would it be?
</h2>
        <p>I like Shakira's message best: "Goodness and generosity create loving energy." Many people are so busy and focused on materialism that they forget that a little kindness can give so much joy and love to others.  It can be something small, such as baking bread to take to a friend who is sad or smiling to the cashier in the supermarket. A wise person once said to me:  "All you give out will come back to you.  Never give something as a loan but as a present." I think it is so right, and I always try to keep that in mind.</p>
        
        <h2>Do you have all the cards?</h2>
        <p>I have almost every card.  I haven't been lucky enough to get all of the energy cards yet but I'll keep on collecting. I also have a profile on our website. It's fun to take care of my horse there and try all the new games. I'm too old in some ways, but the child in me LOVES it.</p>   
        
        <h2>Have you ever made up a card yourself?</h2>
        <p>No I haven't, I would love to take the honor but we have some very good artists who do the pictures. I helped my mom come up with horse names and helped decide which messages would be good. I helped in an indirect way to come up with the name Bella Sara, because Bella is the name of my old pony and Sara, yes that’s me. I'm proud to be a part of it, but my mom is the one who did it!</p>
         
        <h2>What is your favorite breed of horse?</h2>
        <p>My favorite breed is the Danish warm-blooded. I like their athletic and elegant looks.  They have a temper that fits mine perfectly and most of them love to work.  I ride in many competitions so it is very important for me that they are built to "work.” I also like ponies, because they are so cute and they have so much personality. The most important thing to remember when you buy or ride a horse is that you have a fit in temperament, that way both you and the horse will feel the most joy.  My horse is beautiful and when I first saw him I knew he was the horse for me.  My naughty but very loving horse... Isn't he just a sweetie?</p>
            
        <h2>What is your "dream horse"?</h2>
        <p>My dream horse in real life is a horse full of personality, one that I can communicate with in a special way. He should be pretty, brown or black with a white blaze and four white socks. He should love to work and to compete and explore nature. He should be warm in temper but not stupid. He should always love to be pottering.  I’m so lucky to actually have my dream horse in real life. In my fantasy he should be black, with white blaze and socks. He should have a long, thick tail and mane. He would have a strong appearance but be the most loving and caring creature I have ever met. He should be a friend to everyone and share his wisdom with those who need it. He would be the leader of a herd, and protect them with every power he has. I so wish I was a good painter so you could see him!</p>    
                
        <h2>Have you competed? What is your favorite competition?</h2>
        <p>I have competed a lot, actually since I was 6 years old. I tried many disciplines, mostly dressage and show jumping, but I also tried different pony games.  I earned a first place in 1996 in the discipline of riding with eggs. ;-)  After I got the "new" horse I mostly ride dressage, because he is bred for dressage and because he is young.</p>                     
                
        <h2>Other than riding, what sports do you play?</h2>
        <p>I use almost all my free time on my horse. But I try to go to spinning once a week. We also live right by the forest, so we go for walks, or for a run.  I would love to learn to play golf. I also like to watch Formula 1 auto racing, riding competitions and football; it's amazing how the stadium is alive during such big events.  I don't get to do as many sports as I would like to, because I have many things to take care of: my horse, my two cats, our home and my work.</p>
                
        <h2>How often do you go riding?</h2>
        <p>I ride a lot.  I have my own horse so I have to take care of him. I ride 6 times a week. My horse has one day off, when we just do easy things. And then I ride him in dressage, jumping and out in nature the other days, sometime two times per day. My riding teacher also rides my horse sometimes and I get riding lessons two times per week. We also often go to competitions on weekends.</p>
