                                    If you are under the age of 13, BSC requires a parent's or guardian's permission
                                    before we can collect your personal information. We do this by asking for your parent
                                    or guardian's email address. We will send your parents an email when you register
                                    requesting their permission. More information on the process we use is described
                                    below in the NOTE TO PARENTS.</p>

                                    The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide our visitors with information about
                                    our website, which we hope will promote informed choices and decisions about how
                                    to use the site, as well as protect our users' privacy.

                                    BSC recognizes that some younger visitors may not understand some of the information
                                    contained on our website or how the site operates. Please discuss this statement
                                    with your children so that they will better understand how to use the site and the
                                    information they may be asked to provide.
                                    <br />
                                    BSC will collect personal information from children under the age of 13 only with
                                    parental permission. We make every attempt to inform your children of this policy
                                    wherever this information is collected. However, please note that we do not have
                                    the internal mechanisms to confirm the accuracy of the statements they provide to
                                    us.

                                    BSC will not require a child to disclose any more information than is necessary
                                    to register and use the Site.<br />
                                    Because BSC does not share personal information collected by our website users with
                                    third parties, we are able to obtain consent from parents or guardians through email.
                                    When a child under the age of 13 registers for a contest, survey, or website membership,
                                    we will send an email to parents. Parents will be given 48 hours to refuse their
                                    child's registration. If the parent refuses membership, we will delete your child's
                                    information from our database. If we get permission or if we don't hear back in
                                    48 hours, we will assume it's acceptable for your child to be registered on our
                                    site. Once we get permission, we will assume that it is alright for a child to enter
                                    any contest, survey, or membership activity associated with that website.
                                    <br />
                                    Permission for some of our websites may include permitting your child to submit
                                    photographs to our website. Therefore, your permission grants BSC the right to post
                                    photographs of your child on our website. Please read our Terms of Service for more
                                    information on the content and materials that BSC allows to be posted on our websites.<br />
                                    If you suspect that your child has offered personal information in error and/or
                                    you wish us to remove their profile from our database, we are happy to do so. Please
