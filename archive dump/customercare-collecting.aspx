<hr />

<h1 class="product-header">How do the cards work?</h1>
<p>Cards are published for a limited time in "sets.” Cards can come in single card packs, double card packs, bonus boxes and gift tins. For a store near you, click <a href="http://www.bellasara.com/shop_pointer.aspx">here</a>. Each Bella Sara trading card pack contains a random selection of cards. You won’t know which specific cards are inside any pack until it’s opened. The pictures on the packaging do not indicate what cards are inside, other than which set they belong to.  Some cards might be cards you already own; some will be different and new. Opening each pack is a surprise. </p>

<h1 class="product-header">Why should I collect cards?</h1>
<p>Card collecting is a very popular hobby and with all of the beautiful art in each Bella Sara trading card series who wouldn’t want to collect them all?! A number of binders and transparent card sheets are available to help you organize and display your cards and we provide downloadable card lists for every set so that you can keep track of your collection.   Card sets are published, for a limited time, three times a year.</p>

<h1 class="product-header">How do I collect cards?</h1>
<p>There are many ways to collect cards most Bella Sara collectors get started by choosing a specific set to collect.  Below is a list of the sets released in the United States and their card checklists.  After each set goes on sale we will update this list.  Cards lists are handy for both collecting and trading.  Use the checkboxes to keep track of which cards you have collected and which you have not found yet. </p>

<h1 class="product-header">How many different kinds of Bella Sara cards are there?</h1> 
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Common</i></b> cards activate a horse in your stable.</p>
<p><b><i>Rare</i></b> cards also activate a horse in your stable but, as the name suggests, they are a bit harder to come by.  </p>
<p><b><i>Shiny</i></b> (or foil) cards are special foil versions of <i>Rare</i> Bella Sara trading cards.  These extra-rare cards have a special foil treatment that makes them shimmer and shine. If you activate a shiny horse, it will appear as a regular horse and you can also play with it just like a regular horse but you still have to activate the regular version separately to complete your collection. Shiny cards are easy to identify (of course!) but not easy to find. They only appear one in every 6 packs of cards on the average.  Shiny cards in First Edition and Second Series have an “F” before the collector number (standing for “Foil”). Shiny cards for Northern Lights, Ancient light and new sets have an “S” before the collector number (standing for “Shiny”). <br />Since Shiny cards have their own set, you can collect the non-shiny version, and the shiny version to complete your whole collection!  For example:  Hummingbird’s Collector Number is F1/27. Hummingbird appeared in Second Series, so her card has a gold border.  So Hummingbird is Shiny ( Foil) card number 1 out of 27 total Shiny cards in the Second Series Set.</i></p>
<p><b><i>Energy</i></b> (also known as “Friends” “Toy” and “Treasure”) cards:  Cards that do not have horses on them are called energy cards. Energy cards represent horse-related gear and other amazing treasures that activate a digital object into your “My Things” treasure chest.  In the Magical Friends set, energy cards are also called “Friend” cards, since they depict magical, friendly creatures.  In the Baby Bella set, energy cards are also called “Toy” cards, since they show various toys.  In the Treasures set, energy cards are called “Treasure” cards. </p>
<p><b><i>Promo Cards</i></b>:  Promo is short for the word “promotional.” That means that these cards are not included in the regular set. In fact, they are not included in card packs. Right now you can only find them by: </p>


<p>     Attending a special event where they are given out.<br />
     Finding them in other Bella Sara products, like the Value Boxes and Collector Tins.<br />
</P>

<p>You’ll know a promo card because they have an unmistakable letter “P” before the collector number.  For example:  Erinn is card number P2/4 for the card set she originated from.  Meaning that a total of 4 promo cards were made for “Northern Lights” set, and she is #2 out of the total 4.  Erinn was given out for free in stores that were selling Bella Sara “Northern Lights.”</i></p>

<h1 class="product-header">What do the numbers on the side of the card mean?</h1>
<p></p>
<p><i><u>Example</u>:  Luna's collector number is 19/55. This means Luna is the 19th card in a set of 55 total cards. </i></p>

<h1 class="product-header">Some cards are easier to find than others.</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Common</b>: Commons are the easiest to find and collect.  They are marked with a circle (●) symbol after the card collector number.</li>
<li><b>Rare</b>: You'll usually get one rare card in your pack. Energy cards and some of the hard-to-find horses are rare and are marked with a square (■) symbol after the collector number.</li>
<li><b>Extra-Rare</b>: If you don't get a rare in your pack, you'll get an extra-rare card instead. The extra-rares are the shiny foil versions of the rare horses. They're really hard to find! Only one of every six card packs has an extra-rare card inside.  They are easy to spot but their collector number has a diamond (♦) symbol after it.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="product-header">What should I know about trading my cards?</h1>
<p>When trading cards, make sure you only trade cards that have not been activated. <b>Once a card is activated, it cannot be reactivated by someone else, and we cannot deactivate it for you.</b></p>

<!--<h1 class="product-header">What games can I play with my Bella Sara cards?</h1>
<p>You can play many different games with Bella Sara cards. For some basic game instructions, check out <a href="gamerules.html">www.bellasara.com/gamerules.html</a>. Bella Sara Card Packs also include activity cards with game rules on them. You can also make up your own games and share them with your friends!</p>--> 

<h1 class="product-header">How do I buy individual cards to complete my collection?</h1>
<p>You can’t buy all of the individual cards, but you can trade cards with your friends to complete your collection. Each set has a card list which is available on the website for you to download and use to keep track of your collection, how many cards you have, and how many you still need. You can also find several promo cards for sale at the <a href="http://shop.bellasara.com/"> Bella Sara Store</a>.</p>
<p>Tip: When trading cards, make sure you only trade cards that have not been activated. Once a card is activated, it cannot be reactivated by someone else and we cannot deactivate it for you.</p>
