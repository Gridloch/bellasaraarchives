While riding your horse, try to collect rings with your lance.  To control the lance, click and drag it with your cursor. Practice, practice. The lance is heavy so you may have to release and drag several times to keep the lance in the right position.  If you choose Hard skill, the rings will be smaller and harder to collect.</text></help></ingame></xml>
