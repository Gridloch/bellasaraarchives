	<how_to_play2>The further your mouse is from Treasure, the faster you’ll move.

Electric eels and Jelly fish will zap you and cause you to move slowly.

Bubbles replenish your energy so you can move faster.

Schools of fish allow you to swim faster.

Pearls keep you safe from all danger for a short time.

The game is over when the bubble timer, located below your score, pops.</how_to_play2>
