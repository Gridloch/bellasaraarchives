						<bodyCopy><![CDATA[<tab>Winter frosted the rose garden where Rosebriar the unicorn lived. A sudden ice storm had frozen the roses right on their stalks. The roses were beautiful, covered in icy glass. The whole garden was a frosty picture of splendor. Snow covered pathways wound through the bushes and hedges.<br/><tab>But for all the beauty it was still very cold there. Rosebriar’s silky coat was not much of a help against the chill. But the horses North of North had magic and she used hers to keep warm. Her friends the rose dragons were not so lucky. The winter had been very hard and they huddled beneath Rosebriar’s silky mane trying to keep warm. She would never abandon them in the garden where they made their home with her, but she was concerned that the winter was too cold for them.  If it lasted much longer, they might perish. Spring had better come soon.<br/><tab>As if her thoughts had summoned them, two twinkle imps peeked out from the hedge surrounding the garden. Rosebriar whinnied a greeting. She knew that where twinkle imps scampered, the horse known as Beran would soon follow. His magic signaled the melting of the snow and the change of the season from winter to spring.<br/><tab>True to form, Beran soon peered over the hedge into the garden. As he did the snow and ice melted from the garden, and his heart melted also. There stood the most beautiful horse he had ever seen and he instantly fell in love. Rosebriar was also smitten by the sight of Beran and she immediately went to him. As the snow melted the garden came alive again with twinkle imps and rose dragons dancing around and love in full bloom.<br/><br/>]]></bodyCopy>

						<bodyCopy><![CDATA[<tab>Anemone lived in the sky; she made her home among the clouds that drifted high above North of North. She was very happy living there with her whiffle bear friends. They ate “cloud blossoms” which were flowers that grew in the billowing clouds. Her whiffle bear friends braided them into her mane and tail. Anemone had never seen any other flowers except cloud blossoms because she never left her clouds.<br/><tab>One day a strong proud horse flew past her cloud. His name was Uranus. He had seen Anemone many times in her cloud home, but she had ignored him every time he flew by. She wanted nothing to do with a horse as proud and mysterious as he was. Uranus had fallen in love with the beautiful white horse with the amazing red wings. He tried everything to get her attention. He flew by very fast, but she ignored him. He did amazing acrobatic feats in the air, loops and dives, but she didn’t even turn her head.<br/><tab>Then one day he got an idea; he noticed that she loved the cloud blossoms. They were everywhere, on her clouds, in her mane and tail. But they were the only flower that grew in her home. He swept down to the ground and went to his friend Rosebriar. She gave him a single red rose. He flew back up and gave the rose to Anemone. She instantly fell in love and they have been together ever since.<br/><br/>

Ondine loved playing with her friends, but sometimes she was lonely and wished there was another horse on her lake to play with.<br/><tab>One morning Ondine got an idea. She blew a special bubble. Up the bubble went on the morning breeze. It left Ondine’s lake and followed the river down toward the sea. The bubble drifted over the waves where Flipper the water horse was jumping in the surf.<br/><tab>As Flipper jumped and played something caught his attention. He saw a bubble drifting toward him. But this was no ordinary bubble. This bubble was heart shaped. Flipper was amazed; he had never seen such a bubble. He reached up and touched it with his nose. In that instant he knew Ondine had sent that magical bubble out to find him. The bubble turned pink. He blew on the bubble and it drifted up and back to the lake.<br/><tab>Ondine waited expectantly as the bubble came toward her. As it landed at her feet, the pink heart-shaped bubble popped and a thought-image formed in her mind.  Ondine knew that Flipper waited for her down by the sea. She ran as fast as she could over the river down to the beach. There, waiting for her in the surf, swam Flipper. He leaped from the water in greeting. Ondine would never be lonely again.<br/><br/>]]></bodyCopy>

One herd was led by a beautiful white mare; she was full of joy and energy. The other herd was led by a black stallion that lived life every day like it was his first.<br/><tab>Both horses were very different from the rest of the horses in their herds. Both were powerful horses who protected the others, and both knew more than any ordinary horse could possibly know. They knew when it would rain or shine, they knew where the safest places were, and they knew that somewhere in North of North lived another horse just like them.<br/><tab>These two horses spent many years leading their herds over mountains, meadows and around seas, always sensing that they were coming closer to one another with each step. One cool clear morning they both came to the opposite side of a great lake. The water of the lake rippled, but there was no wind. All of the rest of the horses in the herds froze like statues in a garden, as enchantment held them in place.<br/><tab>The two leaders moved around the lake. As they approached each other the whole world stood still for a moment. Their noses touched and a great wind blew out of the north touching everything and setting destiny in motion.<br/><tab>Bella and Bello knew they would be together forever.<br/><br/>]]></bodyCopy>
